/*
Pointers are used in method receivers in Go for two main reasons:

1. Efficiency: When a large struct is passed by value to a method (i.e., without using a pointer), the entire struct must be copied, which can be inefficient in terms of memory and performance. When a pointer to the struct is passed instead, only the memory address of the struct is passed, which is typically much more efficient.

2. Modification: If you want your method to modify the state of the receiver, the receiver must be a pointer. This is because Go is a pass-by-value language, meaning that when a value is passed to a function, a copy of that value is made in the function's scope. If the function modifies the copy, the original value is not affected. But if a pointer to the value is passed, the function can modify the original value.

In the case of your code, both `Service` and `MockDatastore` methods are defined with pointer receivers because the methods may need to modify the state of the receiver. For example, `MockDatastore.SaveUser` needs to add a user to the `Users` map of the `MockDatastore`. If `md` were not a pointer, `SaveUser` would receive a copy of the `MockDatastore`, and changes would only be made to that copy, not the original `MockDatastore`.

```go
func (md *MockDatastore) SaveUser(u User) error {
    _, ok := md.Users[u.ID]
    if ok {
        return fmt.Errorf("User %v already exists", u.ID)
    }
    md.Users[u.ID] = u
    return nil
}
```

Also, note that even when methods only read the receiver's data, you might still want to use a pointer receiver for efficiency reasons, especially if the struct is large.

When the hashtable grows, we allocate a new array
